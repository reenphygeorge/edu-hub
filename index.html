			<p class="small-text2">Education is the process of facilitating learning or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, story-telling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formattive effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called Pedagogy.<br><br><br><br></p>

			<p class="big-text2">Transforming Education in India<p>
			<p class="small-text2">Many public schools provide a free education through the govt. Parents may send their own children to private schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places some children can't go to school because their countries do not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or because the children have to work for money, or because the society have negative prejudice on education for girls.<br><br><br><br></p>

			<p class="big-text2">Lets Grow Together</p>
			<p class="small-text2">Education began in pre-history as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed.<br><br><br><br></p>
